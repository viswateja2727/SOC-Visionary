# Weekly Reading Plan â€“ Week 8: Instance Segmentation

This week, we focus on **Instance Segmentation** â€” the task of identifying, detecting, and segmenting each distinct object in an image. Unlike semantic segmentation, which labels all objects of a class with the same label, instance segmentation also differentiates between individual objects of the same class.

## ðŸŒŸ Closing Note

This marks the **end of our 8-week journey** into the world of **Computer Vision**. From loading and visualizing images to understanding deep networks, segmentation, and detection â€” you've come a long way.

It wasn't just about learning tools and models. It was about developing a new way to *see* the world â€” through the lens of pixels, patterns, and possibilities. ðŸŒˆ

Thank you for staying committed, curious, and open throughout this learning path. I hope these weeks have sparked in you not just understanding, but **inspiration** â€” to go further, build more, and keep questioning.

This isnâ€™t the end. Itâ€™s just the beginning of something deeper.

**Keep exploring, keep creating.**  
â€“ With gratitude and belief in your journey ðŸ’«
