**Weekly Reading Plan**

Let us begin this week with the basic building blocks of Deep Learning, a **Neural Network**. 

Neural Networks have become a huge hit in the recent Machine Learning craze due to their significantly better performance than traditional Machine Learning algorithms in many cases. The art and science of Deep Learning is built on the foundation of Neural Networks and how they work. Hence demystifying Neural Networks is going to be the first step in demystifying Deep Learning. Letâ€™s dive in!
