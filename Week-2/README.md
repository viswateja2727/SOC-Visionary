 # 📚 Weekly Reading Plan – Week 1: The Building Blocks of Deep Learning

This week, we begin our journey into the world of **Deep Learning** by understanding its most fundamental unit — the **Neural Network**.

Neural networks are at the heart of today’s Machine Learning revolution. Their ability to model complex patterns has made them the go-to choice for tasks ranging from image recognition to natural language processing. Before we explore advanced architectures and frameworks, it's essential to build a solid understanding of how these networks work.

Let’s demystify neural networks and lay the foundation for everything that follows!
