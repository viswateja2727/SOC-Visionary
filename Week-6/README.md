# Weekly Reading Plan – Week 6: Object Detection & Localization (YOLO, Faster R-CNN)

This week, we move beyond **classification** to teach machines not only **what** is in an image but also **where** it is. You'll dive into **object detection**, a critical computer vision task used in self-driving cars, security, health tech, and more.

By the end of the week, you’ll use state-of-the-art models like **YOLOv5** or **Faster R-CNN** to detect objects in images and videos, including training on custom datasets.

## 🎯 Goals for the Week

- Understand the difference between **image classification** and **object detection**.
- Learn about bounding boxes, IoU (Intersection over Union), and mAP (mean Average Precision).
- Use pretrained object detectors (Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5).
- Train YOLOv5 on a **custom dataset**.
