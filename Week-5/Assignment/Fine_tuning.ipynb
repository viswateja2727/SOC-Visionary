    "## **Fine-tuning a Pretrained ResNet model for Image Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will explore the concept of transfer learning by fine-tuning a pretrained ResNet model for the task of image classification. ResNet, or Residual Network, is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that has achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of visual recognition tasks. Pretrained models are models that have been previously trained on large datasets, such as ImageNet, and can serve as a starting point for new tasks by leveraging learned features. By fine-tuning the pretrained ResNet, we aim to adapt its feature representations to a new dataset, improving both training efficiency and model performance. This process involves adjusting the modelâ€™s final layers to suit the specific classification problem, while retaining the learned features from earlier layers. At the end we compare the prformance of the pre-trained model with that of the fine-tuned model."

    "1) This function, <blue>**compare_predictions**</blue>, is designed to visually compare the predictions made by a <green>**pre-trained model**</green> and a <green>**fine-tuned version**</green> of that model, helping to assess the impact of fine-tuning. It takes in both models, a dataloader, the directory path containing class labels, and the number of images to display.\n",
    "2) <blue>**Model Evaluation Mode**</blue>: Both the <green>**pre-trained**</green> and <green>**fine-tuned models**</green> are set to <green>**evaluation mode**</green> using <blue>**.eval()**</blue>. This ensures that no gradients are calculated during the forward pass, making inference faster and memory-efficient.\n",

    "4) The first subplot shows the prediction from the <blue>**pre-trained model**</blue> along with its <green>**corresponding class name (retrieved from**</green> the <blue>**classes_dict dictionary**</blue>). The second subplot shows the prediction from the <blue>**fine-tuned model**</blue> for comparison. This allows easy visual inspection of how fine-tuning has affected the model's ability to make accurate predictions."
