# 🧠 Weekly Reading Plan – Week 4: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This week, we dive into **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** — the backbone of computer vision tasks. You'll explore how convolutional layers, filters, pooling, and feature maps work together to extract meaningful information from images. By the end of this week, you’ll **build and train a CNN using PyTorch** on image data like MNIST or CIFAR.

## 🎯 Goals for the Week

- Understand the building blocks of CNNs: **convolutions**, **filters**, **activation maps**, and **pooling**
- Learn how CNNs excel at **image classification**
- Implement a CNN using **PyTorch**
- Train and evaluate your model on image data
