    "## **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNS) for Image Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we explore the capabilities of a popular deep learning architectures — Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) — by training them on various datasets and comparing their performance. While ANNs serve as a versatile model for a range of tasks, CNNs are specifically designed for handling spatial data, making them particularly effective for image classification problems. By evaluating these models, we aim to highlight their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability for different types of data, providing insights into their real-world applications."
