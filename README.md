**Visionary** is a structured deep learning project focused on computer vision. As mentors, we will be guiding you through a hands-on journeyâ€”from understanding image data to building advanced models for classification, segmentation, and object detection.

Over 8 weeks, exploring the foundations of neural networks and PyTorch, progressing to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), semantic segmentation, and real-world object detection. Emphasis was placed on practical implementation, model tuning, and evaluation using real or custom images.

This project aims to bridge the gap between theory and application, empowering learners to build scalable and effective vision systems. Whether you're a beginner or scaling up your ML skills, Visionary provides a launchpad into deep learning with computer vision.
