# 📚 Weekly Reading Plan – Week 3: Training Neural Networks & Getting Started with PyTorch

This week, we combine **core deep learning training concepts** with hands-on learning in **PyTorch**. You’ll learn how models actually improve during training using **loss functions**, **backpropagation**, and **gradient descent**—and you’ll start implementing these ideas using PyTorch.

---

## 🧠 Goals for the Week

- Understand **loss functions**, **gradient descent**, and **backpropagation**
- Learn about optimizers like **SGD**, **Adam**, and how they affect training
- Get hands-on with PyTorch: tensors, autograd, and basic neural networks
- Train a simple neural network on real data (like MNIST)
